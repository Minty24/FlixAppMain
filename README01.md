## Flix Part 1

### User Stories
I will build the first part of a movie browsing app--similar to Fandango and Rotten Tomatoes--that 
lets a user view and scroll through a list of movies. To do this, I'll learn how to get data from the internet 
(via an API) and display it in a scrollable list in your app; two core concepts I'll use in virtually every app I'll 
ever build! When finished, my app will look similar to the app pictured below.

#### REQUIRED (10pts)
- [x] (2pts) User sees an app icon on the home screen and a styled launch screen.
- [x] (5pts) User can view and scroll through a list of movies now playing in theaters.
- [x] (3pts) User can view the movie poster image for each movie.

#### BONUS
- [x] (2pt) User can view the app on various device sizes and orientations.
- [x] (1pt) Run your app on a real device.
